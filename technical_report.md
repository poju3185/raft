The implementation of the Raft algorithm in `raft.py` involves several key components and design decisions:

### PersistentState and LogEntry Data Structures
- `PersistentState` keeps track of the current term and the candidate the node voted for.
- `LogEntry` represents individual log entries with actions, topics, terms, and messages.

### Role Enumeration
- Defines `Follower`, `Leader`, and `Candidate` roles to manage state transitions.

### Node Class
- Manages node state, including ID, peers, role, log entries, and timers for elections.
- Implements an election process with `run_election` and `broadcast_vote_requests` methods.
- Handles vote requests and append entries through `rpc_handler`, `handle_vote_request`, and `send_append_entries`.

### Design Decisions
- Serialization and deserialization of RPC messages to communicate between nodes.
- Use of threading for concurrent operations, like election timers and heartbeat loops.
- Locks and conditions to manage access to shared resources and synchronize state changes.

### Shortcomings
- Error handling is minimal, particularly in network communication, which can lead to nodes becoming unresponsive or inconsistent.
- The implementation assumes reliable network conditions and does not explicitly handle network partitions or message loss.
- The use of hardcoded intervals for elections and heartbeats may not be optimal in all environments.

### Development Sources
This implementation does not explicitly list sources, but the design and structure are consistent with the descriptions found in the original Raft paper by Ongaro and Ousterhout, and common practices in distributed systems programming.
